*	"Lumping" versus "splitting" in science. 
*	Classical estimation bifurcating on a hypothesis test
*	Bayesian estimation
 +	Mixture of models:  Dr. Lump & Dr. Split
 +	Bivariate normal prior on logit scale
 +	The famous ECMO data set.
*	The role of prior information, explored by introducing different identities for "D" and "L".
 +	2 alleles of a gene known to affect this drug's pharmacodynamics
 +	2 alleles of one gene out of a hundred tested, chosen because they are known to affect this drug's pharmacodynamics
 +	2 alleles of one gene out of a hundred thousand tested; nothing known
*	curse of dimensionality,
*	multiple testing and estimation with high-dimensional priors,
 +	D = dark hair, L = light hair
 +	D = dark hair, L = light hair; but hair color is strongly tied to ethnicityâ€¦ which is strongly tied to a key genetic variant
