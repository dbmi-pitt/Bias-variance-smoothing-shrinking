##	"Lumping" versus "splitting" in science. 
##	Classical estimation bifurcating on a hypothesis test
##	Bayesian estimation
###	Mixture of models:  "Dr. Who"
###  Optimizing the mixture with cross-validation
      -> Callout:  "avoiding leaky cross-validation"
###	Bivariate normal prior on logit scale
###	The famous ECMO data set.
##	The role of prior information, explored by introducing different identities for "D" and "L".
###	2 alleles of a gene known to affect this drug's pharmacodynamics
###	2 alleles of one gene out of a hundred tested, chosen because they are known to affect this drug's pharmacodynamics
###	2 alleles of one gene out of a hundred thousand tested; nothing known
###	D = dark hair, L = light hair
###	D = dark hair, L = light hair; but hair color is strongly tied to ethnicityâ€¦ which is strongly tied to a key genetic variant
##	Curse of dimensionality,
##	Multiple testing and estimation with high-dimensional priors,
