*Setup*:  Parametrize the cell count probabilities as  
\[{\bf{p}} = ({p_{RD}},{p_{RL}},{p_{ND}},{p_{NL}}),\] 
which add to 1.  
The likelihood function is  \[\ell ({\bf{p}}) = p_{RD}^{{n_{RD}}} \cdot p_{RL}^{{n_{RL}}} \cdot p_{ND}^{{n_{ND}}} \cdot p_{NL}^{{n_{NL}}}.\]  
Different sampling plans have the same likelihood function but different distributions.

•	If the sample size is fixed by design at 100, then the model is multinomial, and the given parametrization ${\bf{p}}$ is natural.  
•	If the two bottom margins are fixed by design, the model is a product of independent binomials, and the natural parametrization is  $({p_{R.D}},{p_{R.L}})$, where each ${p_{R.X}})$ is the conditional probability ${p_{R.X}} = {p_{RX}}/({p_{RX}}+{p_{NX}})) $.  
•	If both margin counts are fixed by design, then the model is hypergeometric, and the natural parametrization is $({p_D},{p_R},\phi )$ where $\phi$ is the odds ratio  (but that sampling model is impossible to implement in a clinical study).  

These all have different sample spaces.
The thing we care about is ${p_{R.D}}$.
