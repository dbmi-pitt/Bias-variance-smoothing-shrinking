*Setup*:  The data from the table are the four numbers \[{\bf{n}} = ({n_{RD}},{n_{RL}},{n_{ND}},{n_{NL}}).\]
For example ${n_{RD}}$  is shorthand for the number of patients for which the outcome $Y=R$ and the feature $X=D$.

Parametrize the cell count probabilities as  
\[{\bf{p}} = ({p_{RD}},{p_{RL}},{p_{ND}},{p_{NL}}).\]

For example ${p_{RD}}$  is shorthand for the probability that the outcome $Y=R$ and the feature $X=D$. These four probabilities add to 1.

The likelihood function is  \[\ell ({\bf{p}}) = p_{RD}^{{n_{RD}}} \cdot p_{RL}^{{n_{RL}}} \cdot p_{ND}^{{n_{ND}}} \cdot p_{NL}^{{n_{NL}}}.\]  

A likelihood function compares different explanations for the observed data. In this case, the "different explanations" are all the possible values of the probability vector ${\bf{p}}$.

Different sampling plans have different distributions.

•	If the sample size is fixed by design at 100, then the model is *multinomial*, and the given parametrization ${\bf{p}}$ is natural.  
•	If the two bottom margins are fixed by design, the model is *a product of independent binomials*, and the natural parametrization is  $({p_{R~.~D}},{p_{R~.~L}})$, where each ${p_{R~.~X}}$ 
is the conditional probability 

          ${p_{R~.~X}} = {p_{RX}}/({p_{RX}}+{p_{NX}}))$.  
•	If both margin counts are fixed by design, then the model is *hypergeometric*, and the natural parametrization is $({p_D},{p_R},\phi )$ where $\phi$ is the odds ratio. (But that sampling model is impossible to implement in a clinical study).  

But they all have the same likelihood function! The differences in sampling correspond to putting constraints on ${\bf{p}}$, and  different sample spaces for the data ${\bf{n}}$.

For the "personalized medicine" question at hand, the thing we care about is ${p_{R~.~D}}$.
