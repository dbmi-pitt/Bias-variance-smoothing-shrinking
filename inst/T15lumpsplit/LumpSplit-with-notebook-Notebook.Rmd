### Hypothetical medical study demonstrating lumping versus splitting

The Problem:  A new treatment is given to 100 patients.  
Of them, only 8 respond.  But there is a subgroup of 5 in which 3 patients respond, yield
Goal: decide whether to treat the "D" patients.

#### Method

We set the Bayesian joint prior, and compute the joint posterior.

To set the prior on the joint distribution of Pr(R|D) and Pr(R|L), we first convert them to logits (log(odds)).
Then we set a bivariate normal distribution on the logits.
We also convert the observed proportions to logits. We estimate the variances using the delta method applied to the Poisson distribution, whereby the variance of the logarithm of a count is roughly the reciprocal of the count.

(This doesn't work well if the count is near zero , and not at all at zero.
For this reason a "continuity fudge" is applied, if necessary.)

```{r }
require('shiny')
codeToRun = "date()"
output$RunCode1 = renderText({ eval(parse(text=codeToRun)) })
outputRunCode1 = textOutput(outputId = 'RunCode1')
div(h3('click button to run code'), 
    actionButton('idRunCode1', 'idRunCode1'), 
    pre(codeToRun), 'RESULT', outputRunCode1 , 'THERE IT WAS'
)
```
