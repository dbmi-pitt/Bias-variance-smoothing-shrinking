“Of course hair color is irrelevant!  My prior for ${p_R}$ is  Beta( ${a_R}$, ${a_N}$).”
To be fair, we’ll give Dr. Lump four pseudo-observations too, two for ${p_R}$  and two for  ${p_D}$. So ${a_R} = {a_N} = {a_D} = {a_L} = 1$ .  Dr. Lump’s likelihood is 
\[\begin{array}{c}
p_{RD}^{{n_{RD}}} \cdot p_{RL}^{{n_{RL}}} \cdot p_{ND}^{{n_{ND}}} \cdot p_{NL}^{{n_{NL}}} = ({p_R}{p_D})_{}^{{n_{RD}}} \cdot ({p_R}{p_L})_{}^{{n_{RL}}} \cdot ({p_N}{p_D})_{}^{{n_{ND}}} \cdot ({p_N}{p_L})_{}^{{n_{NL}}}\\
 = p_R^{{n_R}}p_N^{{n_N}} \cdot p_D^{{n_D}}p_L^{{n_L}}
\end{array}\]

The part involving hair color factors out, and the posterior $\pi _L^*(p_R^{})$  is Beta(8+1,92+1).
