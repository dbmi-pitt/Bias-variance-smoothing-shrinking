# Bias-variance-smoothing-shrinking

An explanation of key concepts in the statistical selection of subgroups, with a focus on applications to precision medicine. 

Provided as an [R Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), this module provides an introduction to relevant contexts, background reading, interacitve tools, and exercises to explore these topics. 

# Funding

Data science modules developed by the University of Pittsburgh Biomedical Informatics Training Program with the support of the National Library of Medicine data science supplement to the University of Pittsburgh (Grant # T15LM007059-30S1).

# Using the module

## 1. Published Shiny App

This module can be run as an [R Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Simply open the [page on shinyapps.io](https://trials.shinyapps.io/Bias-variance-smoothing-shrinking/).
<!-- https://dbmipittdatascience.shinyapps.io/Bias-variance-smoothing-shrinking/ -->

There are questions found regularly throughout the document. These can be saved to a local text file by pressing links that say "(click to save all responses)." These links will save a file in the local user's download file, entitled  ```_shiny_UserEntries_T15lumpsplit.txt```.which can be submitted to demonstrate completion of the module. 

*NOTE*: Due to embedded PDFs, this app works best with the Chrome browser. 

## 2. Customizing and redeploying.

You are welcome to revise this module to fit your needs, using the following steps:

## 2.1 Install apprropriate software

You will need to start by installing  [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), through links on the appropriate sites.

Once you have R running in RStudio, install these packages:

1. Install [shinyJS](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/basic) by running `install.packages("shinyjs")

2. Install [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/) by running:

```if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()```
